# Microsoft-Rewards-Script
Automated Microsoft Rewards script, however this time using TypeScript, Cheerio and Playwright.

Under development, however mainly for personal use!

## How to setup ##
1. Download or clone source code
2. Run `npm i` to install the packages
3. Change `accounts.example.json` to `accounts.json` and add your account details
4. Change `config.json` to your liking
5. Run `npm run build` to build the script
6. Run `npm run start` to start the built script

## Notes ##
- If you end the script without closing the browser window first (only with headless as false), you'll be left with hanging chrome instances using resources. Use taskmanager to kill these or use the included `npm run kill-chrome-win` script. (Windows)
- If you automate this script, set it to run at least 2 times a day to make sure it picked up all tasks, set `"runOnZeroPoints": false` so it doesn't run when no points are found.

## Docker (Experimental) ##
1. Download the source code
2. Make changes to your `accounts.json`
3. **Headless mode must be enabled when using Docker.** You can do this using the `HEADLESS=true` environmental variable in docker run or docker compose.yaml (see below). Environmental variables are always prioritized over the values in config.json. 
4. The container will run scheduled. Customize your schedule using the `CRON_START_TIME` environmental variable. Use [crontab.guru](crontab.guru) if you're unsure how to create a cron schedule.
5. **Note:** the container will add between 5 and 50 minutes of randomized variability to your scheduled start times. 
### Option 1: build and run with docker run

1. Build or re-build the container image with: `docker build -t microsoft-rewards-script-docker .` 

2. Run the container with:

   ```bash
   docker run --name netsky -d \
   -e TZ=America/New_York \
   -e HEADLESS=true \
   -e SEARCH_DELAY_MIN=10000 \
   -e SEARCH_DELAY_MAX=20000 \
   -e CLUSTERS=1 \
   -e CRON_START_TIME="0 5,11 * * *" \
   microsoft-rewards-script-docker
   ```

3. Optionally, change any environmental variables other than `HEADLESS`, which must stay `=true`

4. You can view logs with `docker logs netsky`.

### Option 2: use docker compose

1. A basic docker compose.yaml has been provided. 

2. Optionally, change any environmental variables other than `HEADLESS`, which must stay `=true`

3. Build or rebuild and start the container using `docker compose up -d --build` 

4. You can view logs with `docker logs netsky`
